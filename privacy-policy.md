# Slur Jar's Privacy Policy

## Data Collection
Slur Jar ("the bot") may collect and store the following data:
- User IDs
- Usernames (to make removing data manually in the database easier by searching the username instead of the user ID)
- Message IDs / Links that contain certain keywords. Note that the message content itself does not get logged, and only the last message ID gets logged.
- Amount of times a user has said a specific keyword ("Slur Count")

View Keywords [Here](https://github.com/ales-js/Slur-Jar/blob/main/keywords.md)

Saved data is stored securely and is not sold or shared with third parties.

Users may request data deletion by doing one of the following:
- contacting @ales.js on Discord (May take up to a week)
- using the `/reset` slash command in DMs with the bot or in a channel where the user has the permission "Use Application Commands"

Note that it is not guaranteed that the bot is always online, if that is the case, feel free to contact @ales.js or wait until the bot is back online.
